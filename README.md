## üí™ Challenges and Solutions
#### 1. Dark Mode Implementation

- Challenge: Implementing dark mode with dynamic color schemes for Pok√©mon types
- Solution: Created a custom theme context with TailwindCSS dark mode utilities and persistent storage
#### 2.  Performance Optimization

- Challenge: Managing large lists of Pok√©mon data efficiently
- Solution: Implemented pagination and virtualization for better performance
#### 3. Type-Safe API Integration

- Challenge: Ensuring type safety with the Pok√©API responses
- Solution: Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses
#### 4. Responsive Image Loading

   - Accessible components

2. **Performance**:
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Caching strategies
